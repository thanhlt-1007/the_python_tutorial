## 4.4. break and continue Statements, and else Clauses on Loops

# Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops

"""
The break statement breaks out of the innermost enclosing for or while loop.

A for or while loop can include an else clause.

In a for loop, the else clause is executed after rge loop reaches its final iteration.

In a while loop, it's executed after the loop's condition becomes false.

In either kind of loop., the else clause is not executed if the loop was by a break.

This is exemplified in the following for loop, which searches for prime numbers:
"""

for n in range(2, 20):
  for x in range(2, n):
    if n % x == 0:
      print(n, "equals", x, "*", n // x)
      break
  else:
    # loop fell through without finding a factor
    print(n, "is a prime number")

"""
Yes, this is the correct code.
Look closely:
the else clause belongs to the for loop, not the if statement.

When used with a loop,
the else clause has more in common with the else clause of a try statement than it does with that of if statements:
a try statement's else clause runs when no exception occurs,
and a loop's else clause runs when no break occurs.
For more on the try statement and exceptions, see Handling Exceptions.

The continue statement, also borrowes from C, continues with the next iteration of the loop:
"""

for num in range(2, 10):
  if num % 2 == 0:
    print("Found an even number", num)
    continue
  print("Found an odd number", num)
